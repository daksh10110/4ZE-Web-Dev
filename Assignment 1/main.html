            <h2>Front End</h2>
            <p>
                Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them 
                directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used
                to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be
                aware of how the field is developing.

                The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the
                information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the
                fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus
                forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to
                ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating
                systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the
                side of the developer.

                    A full-stack engineer is a high-level software engineer that works to design, test, and implement 
                    various software applications. They create software, applications, and scalable web services, 
                    while also providing leadership for coding teams. Full-stack engineers usually possess prodigious 
                    skills and are involved in each stage of software development. This can include data structure 
                    completion, architecture design, code review, performance evaluation, internal tool management, 
                    and updates. The term “full-stack” refers to the engineer's ability to work on both the front-end 
                    and back-end development of an application.
